# pose-estimation-OpenCV
This repository deals with applying the pose estimation to generate npz file for webcam calibration (file is important and is to be used later for Augmented reality applications).

For more information, move on to the following website :
https://docs.opencv.org/3.3.0/dc/d2c/tutorial_real_time_pose.html

The file will be generated in the pose folder. It will be named as ```webcam_calibration_ouput.npz```
